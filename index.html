                        Introducing my AFK program, <span>a solution designed to prevent
                        disconnection due to prongloed idling in a game.</span>This program
                        sends simulated keystrokes to the server making sure that you don't
                        get disconnected during long periouds of inactivity. (I reprogrammed the
                        code to type out "capstone 2024")

                        <p>A simple game I made back in Grade 11 as my final project, <span>it's inspired by
                            Atari's Space Race (1973). </span> I used arrays which I wasn't familiar with
                            in this project for the asteroids, it was a great learning experience for me
                            I learned about appending objects into arrays as well looping though them.
